# OS_File_Sys_Checker
As Part of Operating System Coursework. Designing a File System Checker. 


As with any filesystem, there exists the possibility that errors will be introduced.  In Linux, these errors are resolved using a File System ChecKer (fsck).  Each fsck is custom designed for the file system type so that it can examine everything to make sure it is consistent.  The file system will never be mounted during an fsck operation, so donâ€™t worry about it being changed outside of any changes you may make.

Design a file system checker for our file system. call it csefsck. It will have to do the following, correcting errors whenever possible, and reporting everything it does to the user:

1.	The DeviceID is correct (20)
2.	All times are in the past, nothing in the future
3.	Validate that the free block list is accurate this includes
    1.	Making sure the free block list contains ALL of the free blocks
    2.	Make sure than there are no files/directories stored on items listed in the free block list
4.	Each directory contains . and .. and their block numbers are correct
5.	If indirect is 1, that the data in the block pointed to by location pointer is an array
6.	That the size is valid for the number of block pointers in the location array. The three possibilities are:
    1.	size<blocksize  should have indirect=0 and size>0
    2.	if indirect!=0, size should be less than (blocksize*length of location array)
    3.	if indirect!=0, size should be greater than (blocksize*length of location array-1)
